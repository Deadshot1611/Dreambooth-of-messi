# DreamBooth Training with Stable Diffusion 1.5

In this project, I've undertaken DreamBooth training in the Stable Diffusion 1.5 version by automatic1111, focusing on generating images of a specific individual. In this case, the model has been trained for the legendary Lionel Messi. The project utilizes safetensors generated during the training as checkpoints, which are then employed in the Stable Diffusion web UI to generate outputs.

## Training Details
